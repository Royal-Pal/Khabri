Overview: An Android News App built using RecyclerView, API call and using some other frameworks and libraries. We just call our API to bring data, fetch data from
          those results and feed them into our RecyclerView. I have also used Chrome Custom Tab, like if you want to read the original article then you can click
          on that news and it will open the original article in the app itself.
